# Notate

Notate is an iOS application that allows you to bookmark and comment at different points of a video, and then easily save and share these notes. With Notate, you can associate a comment with a particular time in a video to easily reference it, or to add color to that section. People who watch your Notate will see your comments as the video plays.

More and more of the education system is moving toward video. Notate is a more efficient and engaging way to learn from video lectures. The app can be used simply to re-watch particular snippets of a lecture, or to quickly the gist of the video.
