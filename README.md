# Joomped

Joomped is an iOS application that allows you to discover insightful comments and interesting questions at particular times in a video. With joomped, you can associate your comment with a particular time in a video to easily reference it, or have a discussion around it. People who watch your video will see your comments as the video plays, allowing for a more social video consumption experience. 

Required user stories:

* Ability to share an annotated video with friends which opens the detail page in the app.
